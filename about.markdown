We are the University of New Hampshire's Competitive Programming Club. 
Every week we attempt to solve high difficulty programming problems, by working as a team and coming up with various solutions.
Our meetings are highly cooperative and everyone is encouraged to participate in forming a solution.

Time: Thursday, 6:45 - 8:30 PM

Location: Kingsbury Room N204 (Directly Above Albert's Cafe)
